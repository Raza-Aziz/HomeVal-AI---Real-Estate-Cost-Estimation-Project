# HomeVal-AI---Real-Estate-Cost-Estimation-Project

A Machine Learning Project made by me to practice Supervised Learning, mainly Regression in this case.

## Description

A real-estate cost estimation AI that uses Regression Algorithm to predict the price of the Houses in Bangalore based on features like
- Location of House
- BHK (Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen)
- Bathrooms

It uses Gridsearch CV to find out the best Regression Algorithm to choose with HyperParameter Tuning, and a User-friendly Web app to predict the price of houses based on the trained model.
